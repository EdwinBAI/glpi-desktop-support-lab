# GLPI Desktop Support Lab

I deployed GLPI + MariaDB using Docker Compose to practice ITSM workflows for Desktop Support roles.

## What is completed
- Containerized GLPI deployment (Docker Compose)
- Basic configuration and login verified

## What I’m building next
- Sample tickets (Outlook, printers, login/MFA, network)
- A small KB article set (printer triage, Outlook profile issues)

## Why this exists
To demonstrate ticket hygiene: intake → triage → resolution → verification → closure.
